# Call Center Simulation Project
The purpose of this code is to simulate a casual call center with 
two expert, three amateur, and two technical servers. we prepared
this for "Introduction to Simulation" course project; which was 
instructed by Dr. Nafise Sedghi. For this code to be completed we 
also appreciate Mr. Shahmoradi for his constructive and helpful 
advises.

In this simulation, all service times are based on exponential 
distribution, and all inter-arrival times are poisson distribution 
with different mean parameters. in the presented call center, we
have three subsystems. First one is when a user call and with attention
to the fact that the user type (whether he/she is a normal or special
user) and queue, one of expert of amateur servers will serve him/her.
Second subsystems is call back mechanism. when a user
